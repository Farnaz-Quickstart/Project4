 Sign Up for Render:

Go to Render and sign up (GitHub, GitLab, or email).
Option 1: Deploying on Render
Sign Up for Render:

Go to Render and sign up (GitHub, GitLab, or email).
Create a New Web Service:

From the Render dashboard, click on "New +" and select "Web Service".
Connect GitHub Repository:

Select GitHub and authorize Render to access your repositories.
Pick the repository containing your Express app.
Set Build and Start Command:

In the build settings, set:
Build Command: npm install (or yarn if using Yarn).
Start Command: npm start (or node app.js or similar, depending on your setup).
Render will automatically detect that it’s a Node.js app.

Set Environment Variables:

If your Express app uses any environment variables (e.g., PORT, DB_URL), go to Environment settings and add them.
Deploy Your App:

Click "Create Web Service".
Render will now build and deploy your app.
You’ll get a URL like https://your-app-name.onrender.com for your back-end.
cd server && npm install
